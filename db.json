      "instruction": "To make the dough, combine the flour and 100- 120 ml cold water in a bowl until the mixture comes together. Knead until smooth and soft, then cover with a damp tea towel and allow to rest while you make the filling.\n\nPlace all the filling ingredients in a large bowl and combine well. To check the seasoning, fry off a little bit of the filling in a frying pan, taste and adjust as necessary.\n\nPlace a large steamer on to boil and line the steamer tray with a disc of lightly greased baking paper.\n\nRoll the dough into a log on your work surface, then cut into 20- 22 even pieces. Working with one piece of dough at a time and keeping the rest covered with a tea towel to prevent drying out, shape into a ball, then roll out on a lightly floured surface into a very thin circle about 6 -7 cm in diameter.  Place a generous teaspoon of the filling in the centre and enclose the filling. I take the momo in my right hand and use my thumb and forefinger to enclose the filling by gathering the edges of the dough and pleating as I stick them together. Make sure the filling stays away from the edges. Place directly into the steamer basket, seam-side up. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Once they are all done, place the momo in the steamer, cover and steam for 12-14 minutes or until the dough is no longer sticky.\n\nTo make the dipping sauce, heat a chargrill pan over high heat and cook the tomatoes and chillies, turning occasionally until the skin has blackened. When cool enough to handle, peel and chop the tomatoes, then seed and chop the chillies. Heat the oil in a small frying pan over low heat. Add the garlic and cook for 30 seconds or until fragrant and beginning to colour. Add the ginger, sugar, tomato, chilli and vinegar. Season to taste and combine well, then serve warm or at room temperature with the hot momo.\n",
